## Arch Install Script 

The Arch install script is made to automate the processes that I am comfortable in automating and leaving the others to the user. In the current state the script is extremely barebones with no options or outputs.
I plan to update it in the future to make it more user friendly and provide more user control without needing to poke around in the script.

### How to use the script

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/useraid/BashScripts/main/ArchInstall.sh
