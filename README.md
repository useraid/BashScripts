## Scripts List

- [Arch Install Script](https://github.com/useraid/Debloat-Scripts/blob/main/README.md#archinstall-script)
- [Ubuntu 20.04 Debloat Script](https://github.com/useraid/Debloat-Scripts/blob/main/README.md#ubuntu-2004-debloat-script)


## Arch Install Script 

The Arch install script is made to automate the processes that I am comfortable in automating and leaving the others to the user. In the current state the script is extremely barebones with no options or outputs.
I plan to update it in the future to make it more user friendly and provide more user control without needing to poke around in the script.

### How to use the script

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/useraid/Debloat-Scripts/main/ArchInstall.sh

Make it executable.

chmod +x ArchInstall.sh
```
Run the Script.
```
./ArchInstall.sh
```
