## ArchInstall Script 

The Arch install script is made to automate the processes I am comfortable in automating and leaving the others to the user. In the current state the script is extremely barebones with no options or outputs.
I plan to update it in the future to make it more user friendly and provide more user control without needing to poke around in the script.

### How to use the script

Use 'curl' to download the script.
```
curl -O https://github.com/useraid/Debloat-Scripts/ArchInstall.sh
```
Make it executable.
```
chmod +x ArchInstall.sh
```
Run the Script.
```
./ArchInstall.sh
```
